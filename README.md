# FarmE xpansion II
Farm Expansion II is a continuation of the original FarmExpansion mod from AdvizeGH. I have continued his vision and matured the mod from a single hard coded expansion to a framework supporting modder definable content packs with farm maps that can be used as additional farming land.

The expansion farm supports:

    Barns
        * all of the vanilla animals
    Coops
        * all of the vanilla animals
    Shed
    Silo
    Jumino Huts

Expansion packs are author definable:

   * when the land can be sold
   * how much the land costs
   * the land's world map location
   * thumbnails for the world map and for sale add
   * patching to be done to the target map
   * warps to and from the new land

Land be given to the Player after the requirements are met or the land can be put on sale when the requirements are met.

Land can be available:

   * after X number of game days for price Y
   * the Player reaches skill level X for skill Y
   * the Player marries an NPC and family land is added to the Farmer's land
   * complete Quest X and the land can be given or sold to the Player

See the Wiki section for more details.
